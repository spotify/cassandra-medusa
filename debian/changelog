spotify-medusa (0.0.4) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Keep all needed system keyspaces (includes system)
  * Add 'nohup' to be able to run remote 'sudo' commands
  * Connection through ssh agent allowed (restore-cluster)
  * Make medusacli.py arguments more consistent
  * Clean saved_caches and commitlogs to prevent replaying old requests - especially of system tables, possibly leading to data losses.
  * Added 'Click' module to dependencies as it is used and was missing there.
  * Renamed cassandra.py to cassandra_utils.py to prevent conflicts with the cassandra-driver module on non-packaged setups.
  * Fixed table name using the column_family ID on some places and not in others
  * Add ffwd library and track basic backup metrics
  * Change the order in the path of the files (data/meta after fqdn and backup name)
  * Make backups a low priority task using only idle IO.
  * Split logs from syslogs
